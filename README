<h2>Game Rules:</h2>
You and your opponent start out with $100. This is all the money you will be working with. You need to manage your $100 better than your opponent, and out-bid him 3 times. You'll have to be crafty to achieve a Win here - you might need to give up some rounds to drain your opponenents money. Best way to learn is to try it yourself. Good luck.
